 * The <code>DiscoveryListener</code> interface allows an application to

* provides four methods, two for discovering devices and two for discovering
* services.
*
* @version 1.0 February 11, 2002
* @since 1.1 The JSR 82 specification does not require that implementations
* create individual threads for event delivery. Thus, if a
* DiscoveryListener method does not return or the return is delayed, the
* system may be blocked. So the following note is given for application
* developers :
* <p>
* <p>
* The following DiscoveryListener methods SHOULD return immediately :
* <ul>
* <li>DiscoveryListener.deviceDiscovered</li>
* <li>DiscoveryListener.inquiryCompleted</li>
* <li>DiscoveryListener.servicesDiscovered</li>
* <li>DiscoveryListener.serviceSearchCompleted</li>
* </ul>
