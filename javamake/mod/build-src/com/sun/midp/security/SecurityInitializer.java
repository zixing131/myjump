/**
 * A utility class that initializes internal security. Creates the internal
 * security token and supports its distribution to various packages around
 * the system that need it.
 * <p>
 * The security token is created here and can be passed to various
 * implementation classes around the system. There are two mechanisms
 * to pass the token. The fastest way is to pass the security token to
 * static methods of an implementation classes. These methods, typically
 * named <code>initSecurityToken()</code>, must each ensure they are called
 * only once. This technique works for classes other than those in public
 * API packages (that is, java.* and javax.*). This technique cannot be
 * used for class that reside in public API packages, since the
 * initialization method must be public and adding methods to public APIs
 * is prohibited. Also passing the token to lot of optional classes around
 * the system will cause the classes loading and static initialization,
 * which affects system performance and slowdowns system start up. That
 * is why only a few core system classes are handed with security token
 * over the explicit method call. For most of the other classes the
 * following alternative approach is used.
 * <p>
 * Any implementation class trusted by the internal security system can
 * request <code>SecurityInitializer</code> for security token. The check
 * whether a requester class is really trusted can be implemented in a
 * different ways, e.g. using static list of a trusted class names, or
 * using more specific features of the VM. The need in the optimized
 * implementation for the trusted classes check can be regarded at the
 * product porting time.
 * <p>
 * The approach with security token request on demand makes it possible
 * for numerous optional subsystem to be not loaded and initialized
 * until the very last moment when their functionality is really requested.
 * <p>
 * The important note about trusted classes check. In the case static list
 * of trusted class names is used for the check, it is important to prevent
 * ROMizer from these classes renaming at the build time. Otherwise security
 * system won't be able to identify requester classes by class name.
